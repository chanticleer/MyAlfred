MyAlfred
========

This is where I am keeping my Alfred 2 workflows. I currently have the following workflows:

<strong>File Name Sequencer.alfredworkflow</strong> - This workflow is for creating sequencial file names. You set the base name with 'setname {base name}'. You can clear the count with 'clearcount'. You can set the extension for the file with 'setext'. {shift}{ctrl}o will create a new file name and increment the sequence number for the next time. {shift}{ctrl}i will increment the number in the file name in your clipboard history. Both will put the name into the clipboard history and show it in Growl.

<strong>VideoTime.alfredworkflow</strong> - This workflow contains a copy of ffmpeg. This is used in the workflow to get the length of the video in the file filter and file action inputs. For the file filter, the keyword is 'getvideotime'.

<strong>Alfred Time Keeper</strong> - This workflow is a simple way to track your time on different projects. I will expand on this as I have time, but it is very useful as it is.
