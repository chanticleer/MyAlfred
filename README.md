MyAlfred
========

This is where I am keeping my Alfred 2 workflows. I currently have the following workflows:

File Name Sequencer.alfredworkflow - This workflow if for creating sequencial file names. You set the base name with 'setName {base name}'. You can clear the count with 'clearCount'. <shift><ctrl>o will create a new file name and increment the sequence number for the next time. <shift><ctrl>i will increment the number in the file name in your clipboard history. Both will put the name into the clipboard history and show it in Growl.
