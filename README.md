MyAlfred
========

This is where I am keeping my Alfred 2 workflows. I currently have the following workflows:

<strong>File Name Sequencer.alfredworkflow</strong> - This workflow is for creating sequencial file names. You set the base name with 'setname {base name}'. You can clear the count with 'clearcount'. You can set the extension for the file with 'setext'. {shift}{ctrl}o will create a new file name and increment the sequence number for the next time. {shift}{ctrl}i will increment the number in the file name in your clipboard history. Both will put the name into the clipboard history and show it in Growl.
