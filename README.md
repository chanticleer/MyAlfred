MyAlfred
========

This is where I am keeping my Alfred 2 extensions. I currently have the following extensions:

**Alfred Time Keeper** A time tracking extension that allows for any number of projects and tracking the time between them. Still early stage, but very useable. It also has a basic graphical viewing of work hours with a calendar for lookup.

**Name Sequencer** This workflow allows you to sequence through some file names. You set the base name and extension. It will increment the count and place it in the clipboard and Growl it. If there is a file name in the clipboard, you can also just increment the count for the file name.

**Video Time** This workflow is used to find the duration of a video.
